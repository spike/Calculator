# Android Calculator

This is a basic Android calculator written in Kotlin and licensed under Apache 2.0.

To understand the code in this project, I would recommend starting with its [unit tests](https://github.com/spike/Calculator/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/calculator/calc/CalculationUnitTest.kt).
